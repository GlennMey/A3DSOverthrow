What is this?

Arma 3 Dedicated server Overthrow Template (BAT)
Why make something so simple, well actually to kind of test Github functonality and help out some Server Owners hopefully.

I saw really few Overthrow servers, so I thought i'd add a template for server owners, making it easier and quicker to setup your Overthrow server. These batch scripts doesn't include any restart script.


# Installation

1. Installation: Install ArmA 3 Dedicated server from either your Steam client, or [SteamCMD](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd.zip)

2. Download [ACE](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3/releases/latest) and [Overthrow](https://github.com/ArmaOverthrow/Overthrow/releases/latest), place them in your Arma 3 Server folder.

3. Copy "Starters" and "Overthrow" in root of the Arma 3 server folder. (Where arma3server_x64.exe is located)



# Default settings and editing.

Server name: Overthrow version v0.7.5.3 hosted by Github; change this in (Overthrow/Server.cfg)

Admin login password #login : !123

BattlEye RCON password: !123 (Overthrow\BattlEye\BEServer_x64.cfg)

Difficulty setting: Overthrow recomended, taken from their wiki page. http://wiki.armaoverthrow.com/wiki/How_to_run_a_dedicated_server

I have included batch scripts for using HC's on another computer/server. Write down your #IP in the folder (Starters/Remote HC/HC#.bat)
