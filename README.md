Arma 3 Dedicated server Overthrow Template (BAT)
I saw really few Overthrow servers, so I thought i'd add a template for server owners, making it easier and quicker to setup your Overthrow server. These batch scripts doesn't include any restart script.



Installation: Install ArmA 3 Dedicated server from either your Steam client, or SteamCMD.
Copy "Starters" and "Overthrow" in root of the Arma 3 server folder. (Where arma3server_x64.exe is located)



Default settings:
Server name: Overthrow version v0.7.5.3 hosted by Github; change this in Overthrow/Server.cfg
Admin login password #login : !123
BattlEye RCON password: !123 (Overthrow\BattlEye)
Difficulty setting: Overthrow recomended, taken from their wiki page. http://wiki.armaoverthrow.com/wiki/How_to_run_a_dedicated_server



I have included batch scripts for using HC's on another computer/server. Write down your #IP in the folder (Starters/Remote HC/HC#.bat)
